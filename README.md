# apple2idiot
A general purpose ESP32 IOT board for the Apple IIe

## Status

This is actively being developed (as of September 2021).  It doesn't quite
work, and none of the Apple //e code is up yet because I don't have a way to
transfer it from my 5.25 floppies to here.  But all of this is underway.  Rev
0.2 boards are going to be ordered sometime this month.

### Some of the example programs that have been developed so far

* Get current weather conditions for a city.
* Select Wifi AP.
* Dedicated rot13 string encoder.

### What could be done with an Apple2Idiot card?

Here are some things I'm interested in making work...

* Prodos clock driver (NTP -> ESP -> Prodos)
* Peer-to-peer local area chat/games using ESPNOW or something similar
* Wikipedia access
