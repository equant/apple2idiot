1. Load `00_wifi_scan-basic.dsk` into your Apple II
1. Load `00_wifi_scan-basic.ino` into your apple2idiot card in slot 2.

At BASIC prompt on Apple II do...

```BASIC
RUN CWIFISCAN.BAS
RUN WIFISCAN.BAS
RUN SHOWIP.BAS
```

CWIFISCAN tells the card to scan for access points.

WIFISCAN shows the results, and lets you choose an access point and enter a password

SHOWIP does just that.
